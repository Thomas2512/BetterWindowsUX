(also If you‘ve reached the end of your 12 months and are still a student, you‘ll be able to renew your Azure for Students offer. )
- Then activate the key in windows (if you had a version that is not education, it will ask your for an update) or download windows education and install it, do not login with your account when installing it because it will ask you your university email and it's better to save your key to your microsoft account. when the installation is finished, link your account in windows settings
